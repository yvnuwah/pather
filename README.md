# Pather Coding Challenge
#####Completed by Yvonne Uwah

#####Language used: PHP

## Challenge Instructions

Given that the text file 'input.txt' contains a rectangular block of dot
characters ('.') and two or more hash characters ('#'), write a program 'pather'
which writes out to 'output.txt' the same data with the two '#' characters
joined by asterisks ('*'). The command will be invoked like this:

`pather input.txt output.txt`

Your job is to implement 'pather' in this directory. This script will run it
for you and test the accuracy of the output. The file 'pather' will need to
be executable (chmod +x pather). It maybe written in any language.

The rules for the path:

* No diagonals.
* Only change direction once per pair of hashes. 
* Start with a vertical line and then complete with a horizontal line.

## Running the program
I haven't quite figured out how to run it using the **path-problem.sh** test script. However to run it and test the results manually, enter `php pather.php input.txt output.txt`, replacing **input.txt** and **output.txt** with different text file names as needed.
